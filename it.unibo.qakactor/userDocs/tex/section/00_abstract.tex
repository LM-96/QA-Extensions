\section*{Abstract}

In this paper we discuss new mechanisms to define an executable \textit{actor model} using the custom infrastructure and modeling language given by the course of \textit{Ingegneria dei Sistemi Software} of the Bologna university.

The main mechanism that we present is based on \href{https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/annotations/}{\texttt{Java Annotations}}.
